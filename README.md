This project dynamically calculates the derivative of any function `f(x)` and identifies minimas and maximas. It also plots the function and computes the area under the curve between critical points.

This project is designed to dynamically calculate the derivative of any mathematical function using Python. 
It identifies critical points such as minima and maxima and visualizes them through graphs. 
Additionally, the project can compute the area under the curve between critical points. 
Key features include automatic derivative computation, detection of extrema (minimas and maximas), 
graph plotting, and numerical integration for area calculations. 
The project uses libraries such as NumPy, SymPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for symbolic computation, optimization, and visualization.

## Features
- **Dynamic Derivative Calculation**: Automatically computes the derivative of any function.
- **Critical Point Detection**: Finds minima and maxima using numerical and symbolic methods.
- **Graph Visualization**: Plots the function with extrema highlighted.
- **Area Calculation**: Computes the area between critical points.

## Usage
- Calculate the derivative:
   ```python
   dy_dx('sin(x)')
   ```
- Plot the function:
   ```python
   plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals)
   plt.show()
   ```
- Find critical points and plot extrema:
   ```python
   find_extrema()
   plt.show()
   ```
- Calculate area under the curve:
   ```python
   total_area = sum(areas)
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, SymPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
